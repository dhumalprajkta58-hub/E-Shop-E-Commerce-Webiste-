# E-Shop-E-Commerce-Webiste-
 Created an online shopping platform for seamless browsing, ordering, and product tracking.
E-Shop is a web-based e-commerce platform developed using Python, Django, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQLite database. The system allows users to browse products online, register, login, and place orders from anywhere. The admin can manage products, categories, user orders, and update inventory through the admin dashboard.
The main goal of this project is to provide a simple and user-friendly online shopping system where:
Customers can shop from home
Admin can manage products and orders digitally
Manual process and time consumption are reduced
