 Created an online shopping platform for seamless browsing, ordering, and product tracking.
This system helps organizations digitally manage employee information instead of using manual registers. It stores employee details such as personal information, attendance, leaves, salary structure, and calculates monthly salary automatically based on working hours and deductions.

The system includes modules like employee registration, attendance management, salary calculation, leave management, and payslip generation. Admin can add or update employees, view reports, and generate salary slips with a single click.

The application was developed using Java (Core Java, Swing UI), JSP, Servlet as the frontend and MySQL as the backend database.
